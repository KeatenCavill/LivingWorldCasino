Rough day? Don’t worry, this place has seen worse.
Hey, if you need a charger, check behind the bar.
Folks come and go pretty quick around here.
Music’s a bit loud tonight. Management says it keeps the mood up.
Watch your bag. Crowded nights attract light fingers.
Did you know this place used to be a Union Hall for tradesmen? The railroad engineers still meet here.
You looking for someone?
Keep your voice down—walls are thin, and gossip travels fast.
Don’t mind the flickering lights. The owner’s been ‘fixing’ them for months.
If you see a tall guy in a gray coat, tell him I’m not here.
We had a street performer outside earlier—pretty good, actually.
Stay close to the bar if you want the best service.
Police sirens again… must be a busy night out there.
Don’t stare too long; some folks take it personally.
Someone left their phone on the counter again.
Not many newcomers around here.
You passing through?
Careful heading out—construction’s blocked half the street.

I'm waiting for my Uber to get here.
My phone's dead.
Where's my phone and my keys and my wallet?
Do you think the bartender's cute, too?
Careful with that drink—last one knocked someone out cold.
I think I peed a little.
If the bartender asks, I haven’t seen anything.
The cops rolled through earlier—made everyone nervous.

Happy hour just ended, but I can still hook you up.
Oh, that drink’s on the house. Don’t ask why.
What can I get you to drink?

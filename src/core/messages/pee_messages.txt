Oh no… I shouldn’t have had that last beer…
Bathroom… WHERE is the bathroom?! I… I can’t wait!
If I didn't have to pee so bad I'd fight everyone in line.
Why… why does every bar feel bigger… than my bladder can handle?
Hey! Do you know… do you know where the restroom is?! Hurry!
I told myself one more drink… ONE MORE… and now look at me!
Come out, they said! It'll be fun, they said!
